            <h2>Michelle - Chair</h2>
            <h6>I am of Ngati Porou, Rongowhakaata descent. I am currently employed by Te Puni Kokiri as an Acting Regional Manager for the Māori Business Facilitation Service, Waikato region.</h6>
            <p>My work involves assessing new and existing businesses, and ensuring that Māori SME’s have all the tools they need to establish sustainable and successful businesses. My interests are in Māori SME development, the Māori economy and Māori economic development, tourism, creative sector, and educations, skills and training. I have a background in policy development, funding, and social services. In my current role I am responsible for managing a whole region, and therefore am able to work independently or as part of a team. I am a clear communicator, but am also a good listener. I am married with three children, who are ages 15, 12 and 1 year old. This has kept me very busy and has meant that good time management is essential to meeting all the obligations and responsibilities I have.</p>
            <p>Some of my skills include; Strategic and Business Planning, Governance Training, Policy Development, Research and Analysis, Strong networker, self-motivated, problem solving, relationship management, project management and report writing.</p>
